Development
===========

Currently, to test the source code of netblow, the following test stages and test suites are in place:

- **linters**: flake8, pycodestyle and pydocstyle.
- **unit**: pytest. All networking I/O are mocked in the CI/CD pipeline.
- **integration**: pytest. This suite is run outside of the pipeline because it needs actual networking devices (JunOS, EOS, IOS-XR and IOS).

Since I can't run the integration test suite on travis-ci (CI/CD pipeline), I will use this section to post the results of these tests that I run locally for the record:

.. note::

  Let me know if you can host these instances publicly somewhere, just so I could have full integration with the current CI/CD and increase the test coverage.

.. note::

  I'm running virtual instances of OES, JunOS, IOS-XR and IOS-XE on qemu on Docker engine, so chances are, the performance of the output commands are probably worse that what you would have in a device running the OS natively.
